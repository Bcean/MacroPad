## Macropad

This is a custom **Macropad** project powered by an **STM32** microcontroller. It mimics keyboard inputs for various shortcuts and macros via USB communication. Designed with a focus on low-level firmware and embedded systems experience.

### Features
- Keyboard HID support via STM32 USB peripheral

- Fully programmable macros for media control, copy/paste, and other productivity tasks

- Custom firmware logic written in C

- Planned LED feedback system (future feature)

- Modular design for easy expansion of key layout or functionality
